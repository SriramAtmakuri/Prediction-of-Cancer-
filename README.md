# Prediction-of-Cancer-
This project is based on the predicting cancer using dataset
Generally, cancer has been described as a heterogeneous illness with a wide range of subgroups. Also, the need of classifying cancer patients into high/low assessment criteria has prompted numerous research teams to investigate the use of machine learning (ML) technologies. As a result, these methods have been used to model the progression and therapy of malignant diseases. Furthermore, the ability of machine learning technologies to find essential elements in complex data sets demonstrates their value.

Furthermore, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayesian Classification (NB), Linear Support Vector Machines (L-SVMs), logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest Classifier (RF) are just a few of the techniques that have been widely used in cancer research to develop predictive models that result in effective
and accurate decision making.

Even though it is clear that the application of machine learning algorithms can increase our understanding of cancer progression, adequate validation is required. In this project, we give a critical perspective of cancer prediction based on gene data obtained through literary means of manual data obtained from hospitals, as well as a review of contemporary machine learning approaches used in cancer progression modeling.

The models provided here for prediction are based on a variety of supervised, unsupervised machine learning techniques including the wide range of input variables, data samples.
